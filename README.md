## Demonstration of windowmanagerjs module in Electron, OpenFin, and Web

This is a simple demonstration of the windowmanagerjs module.  It shows the ability to create draggable windows inside and HTML page regardless of context.  So a single codeset can be written that allows for interactive windows in an HTML page running inside the browser, OpenFin, or Electron.  The windowmanagerjs repository is referenced in this project as a submodule and can be found here:

This is a work-in-progress and this README will be updated as the application evolves.
